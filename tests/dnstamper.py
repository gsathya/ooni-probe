    *********

    This test resolves DNS for a list of domain names, one per line, in the 
    file specified in the ooni-config under the setting "dns_experiment". If 
    the file is top-1m.txt, the test will be run using Amazon's list of top 
    one million domains. The experimental dns servers to query should
    be specified one per line in assets/dns_servers.txt.

    The test reports censorship if the cardinality of the intersection of
    the query result set from the control server and the query result set
    from the experimental server is zero, which is to say, if the two sets 
    have no matching results whatsoever.

    NOTE: This test frequently results in false positives due to GeoIP-based
    load balancing on major global sites such as google, facebook, and
    youtube, etc.
